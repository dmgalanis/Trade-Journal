// Generic localStorage cache helpers for the "stale-while-revalidate" pattern
// used across Calendar, DayDetail, and Analytics: render whatever's cached
// immediately (no loading wait on repeat visits), then always refetch in the
// background and swap in anything that changed.
//
// This is purely an optimization layer — every page that uses it still runs
// its normal, full network fetch every time it loads. The cache only affects
// what's shown *while that fetch is in flight*. Any failure to read, parse,
// or write the cache falls back to the page's existing loading state, never
// to incorrect data being trusted as final.
//
// Persists across app closes (including iOS Home Screen PWAs, which are
// exempt from Safari's 7-day ITP storage-clearing timer) — important given
// this app is opened/closed frequently throughout the day rather than kept
// running continuously.
